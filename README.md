## Purpose

In this assignment, I’m preparing for my first meeting with a client who runs a pet daycare. The main goal is to get organized and show that I understand the problems they’re facing. Since I won’t get unlimited time with them, I need to prepare well with good questions, make some logical assumptions, and break down the work clearly.

---

## Scenario Summary

The pet daycare is struggling with how things are done:
- The **owners** are upset because training new employees takes over 3 months.
- The **employees** are frustrated because everyone has their own way of handling new customers.
- The **customers** are confused because the process to get started is complicated.

My job is to prepare notes, questions, and tasks so that I can help create a smoother system for everyone involved.

---

## Assumptions

Since I haven’t met the client yet, here are a few things I’m assuming:
- There’s no formal or written process for onboarding employees or customers.
- Each staff member trains others in their own way, causing confusion.
- There is no software system or platform for managing onboarding.
- A digital system could help everyone have a clear, shared process.

---

## Questions for the Client

To understand the situation better, I plan to ask:
1. How do you currently train new employees?
2. Are there any checklists or documents you use during onboarding?
3. How does a new customer usually sign up or get started?
4. What parts of the process cause the most confusion for staff or clients?
5. Do you use any tools like spreadsheets, apps, or paper forms?

---

## Follow-up Questions

Depending on the answers I get, I might need to ask more questions like:
- Would you be open to using a simple online system to help with onboarding?
- Should the system track progress for each employee and client?
- What’s your ideal process for onboarding — fast, guided, automated?
- Do you want reminders or follow-up messages to be included?

## Basic Requirements (What the system should do)

| Role        | What they need                                                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner/Admin | Track employee progress and reduce training time                          |
| Employee    | Follow one clear and standard process to onboard new clients              |
| Client      | Have a simple, guided process when joining the daycare                    |
| System      | Show progress, store info, and help everyone stay on the same page        |

## First Tasks (Simple Names Only)

- Create GitHub repo
- Write out the current onboarding process (if any)
- Talk to staff and collect feedback
- Make a list of must-have onboarding steps for employees
- Make a list of steps for onboarding customers
- Sketch a rough layout of how the system might look
- Choose the tools/tech stack for the project
- Plan how the database should be organized
- Set up a basic design for the front-end
- Start thinking about how to test the system later

---

## Git Commit Plan

To stay organized while coding, I’ll:
- Create a new branch for each big task (like `feature/client-flow`)
- Write clear messages like: `feat: added mockup for employee onboarding`
- Keep track of what’s done and what needs review
